2020-10-29 16:12:22 : Guilt, shame and trauma : lueyforthethrone : https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/jkcyx2/guilt_shame_and_trauma/

My partner died by suicide in July. He was my first and only love of almost 9 years. He was 28 and Iâ€™m 29. The last interactions we had that day, were an argument. The last texts I sent him, the last words I spoke, and I even wrote an unkind hand written note that day because we were arguing the whole day. All of it was mean and I was drunk and I canâ€™t remember exactly what I said. He ended his life while I was home playing with the dog in the kitchen of our apartment. I was playing with her to cheer up, sober up and get ready to forgive and talk to him....but I was too late and I found him in our bedroom. He didnâ€™t die immediately, but he officially passed away a week later in the hospital. I am so destroyed. Not only was it a suicide, but our last interactions of our loving relationship were unkind. I see lots of posts of people looking back at their last texts saying they love each other. Ours were unkind and I have to live with it. Heâ€™s gone, my partner of 9 years, my soulmate. I had to move out of our apartment because I couldnâ€™t stay in the place he ended his life. Now Iâ€™m back home in my childhood room with family that doesnâ€™t get it.

My siblings donâ€™t ask how I am, even though I only stay in my room and sleep most of the day, my cousins donâ€™t and my friends might check in once a week if Iâ€™m lucky. This happened in July, why the fuck do people think Iâ€™m ok now, if ever? I witnessed his suicide and I had to walk away from the life we built for 9 years. Nobody gets it and I kind of hate everyone. Nobody I know knows partner loss, much less a suicide, much less one you witnessed. No one understands losing the one and only home you had with your love because they did the deed there. And no one understands the crippling loneliness I now feel. His friends donâ€™t text me anymore, but some post of social media about him. I just donâ€™t understand how people donâ€™t ask how I am. I lost my half, and there is a reason theyâ€™re called your half. Our lives were meshed together and we lived parallel to each other. Everyday I talked to him, and almost everyday I saw him. The last 3 years I saw his face everyday. The only person who cared this deeply about me is gone because he couldnâ€™t take this world anymore, and u donâ€™t remember what I said but it didnâ€™t help. And now it feels like I fucking deserve this loneliness, despair and depression. What a miserable existence

2024-03-23 16:02:18 : It's my first dragons dogma ever, but why do I keep dying so much?  : Electrical-Review720 : https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonsDogma2/comments/1blvnum/its_my_first_dragons_dogma_ever_but_why_do_i_keep/

Hello, I saw the trailer to dragons dogma 2 about a month ago and I was very excited after seeing it for the first time and I preorderd it. When it came out yesterday, I played it for the first time and actually had a lot of fun. However, a few things bother me. Why do you lose part of the maximum HP bar after a few hits, which means that you can never get to full HP again. And if I die in a fight, I lose an even bigger part of the maximum HP, how should I beat the fight successfully if I died after a few attempts and if my max HP is to low to beat it ? If I died a few times with a monster, are my chances of fighting a little ever smaller? And do I die more and more? Don't get me wrong, I love the game very much and I'm not a bad player either, but I feel that the game punishes you after each death. Is that correct? I started playing as a fighter but switched to thief because I love dodging abilities since I'm a elden ring player. Do you have any tips?

2024-03-23 16:02:18 : GoPro EDC?  : mill333 : https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/1blvnul/gopro_edc/

Hi all, 

I have been thinking lately on my EDC items etc and some scenarios when i have felt un-prepared etc. 

I have 2 gopros, a black 3 and 4 which are old now and my iPhone 15 beats evetime on camera quality. However, i have been thinking of maybe EDCing my gopro with minimal accessories maybe a head strap or a clip to attached it to me or even just place it down on something to record. 

my logic is when ever a situation gets dicey i see a lot of people get their phones out to record. In my view this is not the first thing i would do as my phone is big also expensive so i limit the exposure to accidents. If i was every in a situation for example, a terrorist attack, walking the dog late at night and getting attacked. having some trouble in town or something its always good to be able to document it for proof and evidence and a gopro would be good to turn on clip on and get away or record and place down to record without worry especially if needing the phone to make a call to emergency services. I think carrying an old gopro would be pretty good having something to hand you can turn on and either clip it to you or place it somewhere or what not. 

At the moment i dont carry my old gopro at all but i think it would be a great addition. I dont have a dash cam either so carrying a gopro would also be good to turn on and place on dash if you was a victim to road rage. 

What are you views on this? The more and more i think about it im liking the idea.

Took my girls to the empty dog park so they could run freely and do all the sniffs. They both promptly had a relax as soon as we got home. ðŸ˜…

My dog is a 6 yr old Pembroke Welsh Corgi and as I was petting her I felt a very small lump went to check it out and also saw small fibrous-like tissue material protruding (small lump under skin). It's located at the bottom portion of her chest next to her right armpit area (heading towards belly, kind of where you would find one if her nipples). It did have a little bit of blood on it which I've rinsed with some saline solution and I'm going to call the vet tomorrow to get it checked on. Just wanted more advice as I constantly overthink about my baby and always think the worst since my dogs are my life and always want them to be healthy. Thanks.

2024-03-24 00:11:46 : I'm an Illiterate Piece of Crap.* : DCFVBTEG : https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1bm783a/im_an_illiterate_piece_of_crap/

A while back I listed a bunch of books on a post to prove a point. Honestly, one of the reasons I did that was to test my knowledge of classic literature. And while I like it, most people can list off a bunch of books. I haven't read as much as I'd like.  
  
The only famous novels I read were Nineteen eighty-four and Of Mice of Men. I read the first in middle school for fun and the latter in high school for education.  
  
I remember in the third act of 1984 when Winston was in the ministry of love. While he was there he made a condemnation of homosexuality by saying the concentration camps were rife with it. Something similar was also said in the appendix.  
  
This really shocked me when I heard it. Like god damn that's homophobic. In Orwell's defense he lived in the 1940s but still doesn't age well. But Fredrick Sinclair was a god lees Comie who denied the Holodomor and I believe a lot of early 20th century writers like Jack London and Helen Keller supported eugenics so I guess George wasn't alone in writers with bad takes.  
  
Of Mice of Men is still my favorite book. Its got great themes around friendship and the American dream. I remember I anticipated Lennie was going to crock as soon as that other guy had to put down his dog. I saw that a mile coming. Nothing against Steinbeck though that was excellent foreshadowing.  
  
I also wanted to read The Outsiders and Lord of the Flies in middle school but got bored and didn't finish them. Weird that in middle/high school, two coming of age novels directed at teenagers stuck with me less than a dystopian nightmare and a solemn tale of betrayal and failure. Guess we all have our tastes.  
  
One book I had the chance to read but ended up reading the cliffnotes to get a passing grade was Jane Eyre. My mom saw I was slacking off on that so she had me watch the movie with her so I could get the plot points. During it I pretended to have read the book and told her the entire plot. She somehow knew I was lying my teeth out.  
  
Speaking of which, I kind of fibbed earlier. I read a few more famous books as a kid. Although that was before I really could look at stuff critically so I figured I'd exclude them. I'll still mention it now though I got the other stuff out of the way.  
  
I listened to an audio book of 20,000 leagues under the seaS with my dad once. I think I liked it. Although later I had to read it for school and I again slacked off on that. I also read Robinson Crusoe in elementary school and really liked it. Had to read Oliver Twist and really hated it. There was this series Smiling Hill I read with my mom. I've got fond memories of that book.  
  
Besides that there were the books by Judy Blume I quite liked. And of course Harry Potter. Never finished it though. Don't know if i outgrew it or just never bothered to finish but whatever the case I stopped around the half blood prince. Later on they had a marathon the movies on T.V. so I pretty much found out the ending that way. Didn't see the point in continuing after that.  
  
That's all I really got to say about books. Besides that there are writers. My brother's favorite writer is Edger Allen Poe. He read all his poems. He was always kind of gothic like that.  
  
I'd have to ask him but I'm pretty sure my dad's favorite writer's got to be Ernest Hemingway. He seems to talk about him a lot and used him as an example of high literature to me once. Could be wrong though he could like Fifty Shades of Gray for all I know.  
  
My favorite author has to be Jules Verne. Haven't read any of his stuff besides Leagues I mentioned earlier. Besides the fact everyone loves a good adventure story. I think it's interesting to see how people in the past pictured the future. Stuff we take for granted today like electricity and automotive vehicles was Science fiction to Victorians. Although I think they called it Science romance back in the day.  
  
I originally intended for this to be a rant on how dumb I am. As I've only really read and enjoyed classic books. But upon writing I've found I have read my fair share of books. I just remembered I read The most dangerous game a while back. so really I've read 3 famous works since 7th grade. Still I don't feel as well read as I should be. Like, I should be able to quote Shakespeare copying down the works of George Eliot in Finnish with my feet. Oh well, One can only dream.  
  
So ya, I like Jules Verne and Of Mice of men. That's the only thing you should really take away from this.
